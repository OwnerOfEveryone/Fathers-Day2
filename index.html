    <h1>Dear Dad,</h1>
    <b><p>
      Itâ€™s me, <strong>Ritika! ðŸ’–</strong>.I just wanted to tell you how much I love you. You are the best dad in the whole world!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for always playing with me, making me laugh, and hugging me when Iâ€™m sad. You make everything better just by being there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I act like Iâ€™ve got it all figured out, but honestly, Iâ€™m always looking up to you. Your advice, your strength, and the way you handle everything â€” it inspires me more than I can explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m so happy and lucky to be your little girl. <br>
      <em>Youâ€™re my superhero, and my favorite person forever.</em><br>
      Youâ€™re not just my dad â€” youâ€™re my role model and my best friend.
    </p>

      Love always,<br>
